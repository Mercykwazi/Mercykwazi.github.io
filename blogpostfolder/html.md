creating html web site
17 July 2017

It was an amazing experience, I created my very first home page and i also git pushed it into my git page.Git pushing my very own home page felt good because the proccess of doing it, I can confidently say that I can now git push my work to my git page.I also got a better understanding on git as it own.

Last week was my first week with the cooding ground, I wasnt sure what to expect, but the experience was good or even better than i expected.
The thought of being tought something i have never done before was a bit scary at the same time exicting because it is going to be a jouney that I am looking forward to.

One of the most importent things I lent was the Importence of reading.
