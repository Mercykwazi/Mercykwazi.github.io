READING IN DIFFRENT LEVELS
14 July 2017

I have a better understanding when it comes to reading now.I used to think that reading for fun was the same as reading for knowledge.
Reading comes in diffrent levels.Elementary and Systermatical skimming reading were the only levels of reading I was farmilier with,but I now gained more knowledge on other levels of reading.

Analtical reading is level were you read diffrent books by diffrent authors thoroughly so that you can have a better understanding on the topic you are reading about,One of the key elements of this type of reading is for the reader to indentify the problems that the author is trying to address and find the diffrent solution and also look for other similar books in oder for him/her to find a solution.I have a clear understang of the diffrent levels of reading

I also gained more knowledge when it comes to html, I used to think that when you have found a code you just type it anyway but i now know there is a style to follow.I have also manage to create my own web page.
