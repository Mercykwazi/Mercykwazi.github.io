Team work can be difined as a group of workers put together in the work place to complete a specific task.
In most cases workers tend to be in teams but not genuin teams(pseudo)they wont be fulfilling  basic requirements of being a team.

Team work has process:
1) transition process(between the period of action)
mission analysis:As a team you will be writing down  and stating the mission statement.

goal specification:As a team you will be writing down the basic goals that you want to accomplish.
Strategy fomulation:As a team you need to figure out how you are going to achive those goals.
2) Action process (about to achieve the proccess)
monitoring progress:checking whether we are still running towards our goals
systerm monitoring:checking if our systerm is in place and ready.
Team monitoring and backup behaviour:checking whether every one is working towards the same goal.
coordination:when everyone is working together and helping one another towards achiving goals that were set.
3) Interpersonal process
conflict management:when everyone starts to consider other people feelings and starts to work together
motivation and confidence building:when as a team you motivate each other towards working as a team and build others who have low self esteam.

It is better to work together as a team than individual because as team you ncan build and motivate each other.
