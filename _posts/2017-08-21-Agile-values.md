>Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools
  As much as tools are the importent part of a team it is more important for a team not to concentrate more on them than the interations between them.
>Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation
   It is better to focus on working software rather than spending time going through some documentation.
>Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation
 It is better to work together with your customer rather than to focus on the contract.
>Responding to Change Over Following a Plan
  It is good to adapt to change as the building of the software continues rather than following the originaly plane.
