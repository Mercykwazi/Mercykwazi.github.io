It is a computer programming principe that states that every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software.
That responsibility should be narrowed alligned with that responsibility.
A class should have one reson to change.
If you have two reasons to change for a single class you should split those functions into two parts.
Each class should handle its responsibility.
