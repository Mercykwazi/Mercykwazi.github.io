The Twitch assignment was a bit challenging for me because I couldn't understand what I was meant to do.
As I understood what I was meant to do It became easy.

What was required: 
A person  can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
A person  can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
If a Twitch user is currently streaming, a person can see additional details about what they are streaming.

My approach:
I had two Api the first one was inside a function using the jsonp format that checks whether or not the person was online or Offline.
I also had a success function that contained  a conditional statement that checks if the person was online and return that the person was online and states what that person was currently streaming.
and It could take you to the persons page.If the person is Offline it states that the person is Offline.
The second Api checked what the person who is online is streaming.

In order for the user to search for who ever they want to see, I created a search box with a button that the user can use.
Under the search box I  created a  container so that the results would be displayed in the container,
inside the container I had a  div which contained an Id that would display the results that has been searched.

I used css to add a back-ground colour and style my search box.
