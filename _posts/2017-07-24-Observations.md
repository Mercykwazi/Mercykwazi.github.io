-Last week was a good week for me compared to the previouse one.
-I managed to share with others in class my reasearch with was an acomplishnent
 for me because am not so good in public speaking.
-I also noticed the importance of team work because it was part of my reaserch.
-What I also observed last week was that my typing is needs improvement.
-It also helps to hear the opion of others about your work(feedback) so that you
can be able to improve.
In order to understand something you have to read it more than once.
         What I need to impove:
-I need to improve of my typing skills.In terms of pace and accurecy.
-I need to put on extra effort in everything i do.
-I also noticed that i need to be more curious about everything i learn,
 and also take notes regulerly so that i can be able to refresh what i had done the
 previous week or day, when im home.
-I need to value feedback more.
