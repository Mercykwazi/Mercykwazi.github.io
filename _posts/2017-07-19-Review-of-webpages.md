-We reviewed each other web pages and codes.
-It was a very good excersise becausee I got a diffrent perspective on how my Web page looked like.
-How I must improve it.What I can add and remove in my web-page.
-I also recieved feedback which was useful regarding my code.
-I got a feedback that I must change the style of my code,because  it was not in order.
-I thought that writting many codes with the same heading in my style was the good thing,
but i leanerd that it was not a good thing,It made my code look messy instead.
