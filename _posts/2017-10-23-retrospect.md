I decided to just write about how my journey at The coding-ground has been like.
It sometimes very good to just look back in life and see whether you are going in the write direction or not.

Well last week we were given a task to complete about the basics things we did, and I could'nt finish the exersise.
That experience thought me a very good lesson to go back to the basics that i have completed in freeCodeCamp.
It also thought me to do more exersise on my own not only relying on the examples that are provided by freeCodeCamp.

At The Coding ground I have lent a lot of things that I never even imargined learning in my life.
One of those things is typing.I remember the first time I practised typing in the typing club I used to type 10 words per minute and that brought joy in heart being able to type in the correct formate.
But now I can type more than 30 words per minute.

From now moving forward I will put extra time and focus in understanding more than just moving ahead in freeCodeCamp,
whith-out a full understanding of what the topic is talking about.
