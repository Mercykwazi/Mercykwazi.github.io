It is  a way of providing interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.

Rest web services allow requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources.

It does this by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.

 In a  RESTful Web service, requests made to a resource's URI will elicit a response that may be in XML, HTML, JSON or some other defined format. 

 In so doing the response may confirm that some alteration has been made to the stored resource, and it may provide hypertext links to other related resources or collections of resources
