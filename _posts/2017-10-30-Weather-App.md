Weather is the condition of the atmosphere,it could be cold,hot or rainy.
It is there-for important to know what the weather has install for you before you plan your trip or day.
In this projected we were to create a local weather app.

In this project I first needed to do a little research about API, how they work so that i could be able to finish my project.
I found APIs very interesting because they are the driving force of my app.
I first had to understand how to transfer information that is appearing on my weather api to be visible for people to be able to view it.
I first console.log the Api so that it could be easy for me to see what I could display for my user to see and what not to display for my user.

I created a function called search() I used  JSONP format  that is were I put my Api address.
I also had a success function inside the function I had a document.getElementById element that had an an html element which I used for my input box in order for the information that the user wants to search to be displayed. The function  would be called immediately the search() function was called.
I also had an id that i declared in my Html that contain the results that the user is searching for.

In my Html I had a search box, were the user can type what they are are searching for and click search the box will return results that was asked for.
I also had a href link that linked to random articles with which I created a button that is click-able If the user just wants a random article from Wikipedia.

This project thought me how to use APIs in any given scenario.It also made me understand Api and success functions better.
