When dealing with code in javascript you can come across variables and constants.
In order for you one to know which one to use you must know the difference between the two.

A constant  is  a value which remains unchanged.
It is a value that can not be altered by the program during execution.
exaple:
var a =1
var b =2

const a=1
const b=2

When you use a variable it means you can be able to change the values of a and b,which in some cased it is not a good thing because you might come across as someone who doesn't know what he/she is doing.
Using a constant also help to minimize confusion because you can not re-assign a constant unlike a variable.

###########Arrays
 [1]var iteam=newArray();
[2]var iteam=[];
-When dealing with arrays the secound methord is best way to use when you assigning your variable.
-It is also best to use array.push insead of directly assigning to add iteam to an array
exaple!!!
var myName=[];
myName.push("mercy");
insead of :
var myNamel[myName.length]="mercy",

Knowing which type of way is to deal with a problem is the best feeling now I know the different ways to use an array and the difference between a variable and a constant.
