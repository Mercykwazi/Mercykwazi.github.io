Last week was my first week with the cooding ground, I wasnt sure what to expect,
but the experience was good or even better than i expected.
The thought of being tought something i have never done before was a bit scary,at the
same time exicting because it is going to be a jouney that I am looking forward to.

I created my very first home page it was an amazing experience, 
i also git pushed it into my git page.Git pushing my very own home-page 
felt good because I now know the proccess of doing it, I can confidently
say that I can now git push my work to my git page.I also got a better understanding on git as it own.
