I have lent about Agile software which promotes team work because it believes 
working together easly gets the job done rather working alone.It also except 
change versus complition, It acknoledges a room for change when building  software
versus the hunt for complition.
The  customer who funds the project must be made a valiable member of the team during 
the proccess of devolopent so that when there any changes you have made as the developer 
you can notify him/her. 
In most cases programmers end up building a systerm that not solve the problem because they
end up being clueless on why they are building that specific software because they did not ask
the customer those importent qustions.
-Design is more expensive and needs a team of expect to draw a design.
-A  creative mindset is needed during design process.
-Construction is much cheaper than design,but constructers also face problems
 that might have overlooked during the design proccess.
-In most cases design does not carter for a budget so the amount is estimited 
 then constructers are left to deal with a design which is worth a huge amount that is not in the budget.
