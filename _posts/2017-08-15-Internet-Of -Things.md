It is the networking of  physical devices,buldings and other iteams embeded with other eletronics,software,sensors and network connectivity,which enables these objects to collect and exchange data.

It allows the controllebility of objects using remotes or sensers across existing network infastrature,creating opotunites for more direct intergration of the physical world into computer based systerm.

It improves effience,accurence and economic benefit,In addition it reduce human intervation.

It is expected to offer advanced connectivity of device or system that goes beyond communications and coves a varity of protocols,domans and applications.

The convegence of wireless techenologies,micro-eletronical systerm,micro-services and the internet.

It has helped tear down the walls between oparational and information technology allowing unstructured machane genarated data to be analyzed for insite that will drive impovements.
