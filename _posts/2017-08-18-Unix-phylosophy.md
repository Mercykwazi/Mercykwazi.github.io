Unix Philosophy
It is a set of norms and phylosophical approches to minimalist modual software development .
It is based on the unix oparating systerm.
It emphasize simple,short,clear,moduler  and extensible code that could be easily maintained.
The same code should be able to be repurposed by developers other than its creaters.
It favours composability as oppose to monolithic design.
Its airm:
make each programm do one thing and that one thing well.
expect the output of every program to become the input of another.
write programs to work together.
when bulding software dont hassitate to throw away clams parts and rebulding them again.
use the tools in prefrence to help lighten a program task.
