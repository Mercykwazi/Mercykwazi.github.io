# composition in java
Java composition is achieved by using instance variables that refers to other objects.
For example, a Person has a Job.
It is the principle that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality rather than inheritance from a base class.
You can achieve this through creation of various interfaces representing the behaviors that the system must exhibit

# inheritance
It is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
You can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.
When inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class, you can also add new methods in the current class.

# benefits of using inheritance
For Method Overriding (you are able to Override methods in using inheritance).
For Code Reusability(you are able to reuse code).
