-I got a better understanding on how Agile works in Companies.
-I also  learned that companies can suffer from stucture sickness.
-Structure sickness is when the company is failing to meet the requirements
of a team that can be caused by lack of principles and values in a company.
-When you are building a software or any other product it is importent to 
first understand why you are building that product before gathering your tools.
-As a team once you know why you are building that product you need to know how
 you are going to build it.
-When you have figured it out how you are going to buid it, you need to set Values
on how you are going to oparate.
-You also need to have Principles(the way you think and make decisions.)
-Once you have your principles you will need to put them into practice.
-Lastly you need to gather tools that you will use to to build your product.
