Dijkstra
-It is analgorith for finding the shortest paths between noods in a graph.
-Edsger W Dijstra discoverd it in 1956 and it was published 3years later.
-It is also used to find the shortest parth between point A and point B
-The algorith runs in time it does not use min-priority-queue
-its main objective was to choose both problem and answer that will be produced by a computer that could be understood by non-computing people.
Merging
-It is a fundamamental oparation that reconcils multiple changes made to a vision-controled collection of files
-the results is a single collection of files that cointains both set  of changes.
Cloning
-In most making an exact copy of an object,frequently under the paradigm of instance-based programming or object-oriented programme.It is also object coping.
