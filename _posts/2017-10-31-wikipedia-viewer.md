The project was to create a Wikipedia Viewer that when the user wants to search for something they can search it and that search would direct them to wikipedia.
I thought to my self this was the coolest project eve have to create a site that will enable people to search for whatever they want from wikipedia and get the results.

With the previous project we did we used APIs so I had a better picture how to start my project.
I created a function called search() I used  JSONP format  that is were I put my Api address.
I also had a success function inside the function I had a document.getElementById element that had an an html element which I used for my input box in order for the information that the user wants to search to be displayed. The function  would be called immediately the search() function was called.
I also had an id that i declared in my Html that contain the results that the user is searching for.

In my Html I had a search box, were the user can type what they are are searching for and click search the box will return results that was asked for.
I also had a href link that linked to random articles with which I created a button that is click-able If the user just wants a random article from Wikipedia.

This project thought me how to use APIs in any given scenario.It also made me understand Api and success functions better.
