####While-loop
It goes through a block of code as long as the specified conditions is true.
A while loop is useful when you already know were your code needs to end.
You don't need to to to estimate when you need your code to break,you need to be certain about the break point of the code.
You can nest a while loop inside a for-loop.

####For-loop
It provides a compact way to iterate over a range of values.
When using a for-loop,you will iterate the code until the given condition reaches, thats when the code will break.
For-loops are usually used when iterating through an array.

#####condition oparators.
X += 2 is the same as X = X + 2;
if you have i and  you want to add 6 to it this could be written as:
i = i + 6
i += 6;
