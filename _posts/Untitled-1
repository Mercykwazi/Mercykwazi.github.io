Ever found linking two or more html pages very tricky and you do not which one to use the  Absolute or Relative Paths.
## Relative Paths
Relative links only point to a file or a file path.
When-ever a user clicks a relative link, the browser takes them to that location on the current site.
When you are linking two pages or files within your site it is best to use a relative link.
The browser knows this by  looking for the location of the file relative to the page where the link appears.
### examples
index.html
 /graphics/image.png
 /help/articles/how-do-i-set-up-a-webpage.html

## Absolute Paths
They  point to the same location in a file system, regardless of the current working directory.
Absolute paths always include the domain name of the website.
When you want to link to another website,absolute path is the best option.
### examples
http://www.mysite.com

# Conclusion
It is very important to be able to differentiate between the two paths.
This two  paths are still the most tricky things to understand in html
