I have a better understanding when it comes to reading now.I thought that reading
 for fun was the same as reading for knowledge.
Reading comes in diffrent levels,Elementary and Systermatical skimming reading were
the only levels of reading I was farmilier with.I now gained more knowledge on other levels of reading.

Analtical reading is level where you read diffrent books by diffrent authors thoroughly
so that you can have a better understanding on the topic you are reading about.One of the
key elements of this type of reading is for the reader to indentify the problems that the 
author is trying to address and find the diffrent solution and also look for other similar
books in oder for him/her to gather more facts and find a solution.

I also gained more knowledge when it comes to html, I used to think that when you have found
a code you just type it anyway but I now know there is a style you need to  follow.
