## Introduction
yesterday I was reading up on Redux below is my summary on how redux really works.
# Redux
Its an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state.
Itâ€™s an application data-flow architecture, rather than a traditional library or a framework like Underscore.js and AngularJS.

## importing
Before you can start with your app you need to import redux so that you could be able to use redux in your application.
You also need to import createStore
## Reducer function
In each and every app that you create using redux you need a reducer function.

## createStore
You also  need a function createStore that takes in two arguments a reducer and the state of that reducer.
the reducer argument will follow what the action or the state is telling to do.

## listen to the createStore
You then need to listen to the store using the store.subscribe,you will use this as a function.

## calling the function
To call your function you use store.dispatch function that takes in two argument the type and the payload.

# Conclusion
This is what I came across yesterday when I was dealing with redux,My next blog post will have more information about redux.
