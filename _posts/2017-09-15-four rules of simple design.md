1....Pass all the test 

	if you write a code not for satisfying a test, you're not even satisfying the first requist.

2....Express every idea you need to express

	If your code hs passed all test you can explecity concepts to show your design.

3....Extract methods and classed all the way down to eliminate duplication

	this rule is widely difused and talked about

    It is simple to see duplication in the majority of cases because of sumplicity of applications.

	There is a trade-off between  extracting and abstracting class of duplicated code and clarity.

4....It is taking out whatever you can from the code without violating rule 1,2 and 3.

	 You should not suffer from deleting useful concerpts and you bar should remain green.

	 No duplication must be introduced.
