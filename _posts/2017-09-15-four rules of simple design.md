The key of being a good developer is having a good design of your work.
Having a good and yet simple design simplefies your work and it also makes your work readeble not only to you but to other people.


There are four main rules that you can follow to make your work attractive yet simple:
	 -Pass all the test 
       Whenever you write a code you must ensure that you test your code and your code passes all of your test. 
	   If you write a code that does not pass the test unfortunately you did satisfy the first requiest.
	-Express every idea you need to express
	  If your code hs passed all test you can now ensure that your code has expressed the idea that you wanted it to express.
      You dont want  a situation were your code has passed the test but it did not express the idea you had in-mind.
	-Extract methods and classed all the way down to eliminate duplication
      If your code is now working you need to check whether there are any duplications ,when your code is simple it is easy to see the duplications. 
	  when using this rule one needs to be careful because there is a thin line between extrating and abstracting class of duplication code and clarity, you dont want to find your self as the victim of that.
	-taking out whatever you can from the code without violating rule 1,2 and 3.
      Now you can take out whatever you want from the the code that you find useless without breaking the first three rules.
	  In this rule one needs to be careful not to suffer from deleting useful concerpts.
	  When deleting you must ensure that you always remain with the green bar that symbolise that you have a working code.
	

It is importent for every developer to have a working a code that is working at the end,
but following this simple steps can ensure that you have a working code that not only work but is also readeble.
Not only to the writer but to other people.
