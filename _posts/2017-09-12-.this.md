The value of thisis determined by how a function is called.

It can be set by assignment during execution, and it may be diffrent each time the function is called.

In global excecution content,this refers to the global object,whether in strict mode or not.

In strict mide, the value of this remains at whatever it was set to when entering the exectution context.

If this was not defined by execution context it remains undifined.

Whenever a function is contained in the global scope,the value of this inside of that function will be a window object.

Whenever a function is called  by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is this.

Whenever a constructor function is called,this refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.

Whenever javascript's call or apply methord is used, this is defined.

The call and apply methord allow you to excecute a function in a diffrent context.

the first argurment sets or passed to these methords set what this points to.
