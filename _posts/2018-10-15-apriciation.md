I would like to take this time to extend my graditude to your team for this genarous donation that you made to the Coding ground.
My name is Mercy Mncube one of The Coding Ground Student,The funds that you gave to the Coding ground would help me to keep on coming to the coding groud and lean more so that I can be able to change my future and the lives of people in my community
I belive that if I can be able to change my future true coding I can also be able to pass on that knowledge to another person in my community.

With the money that you have donated to us,I will continue to have access to the internet,that will have a good impact to my learning as internet is the biggest contributer to my studies.
Some of it will be used for my transport fee so that I can be able to get to The coding groud.

Your support is highly appreciated,may your genarousity continue changing lives in our country.
