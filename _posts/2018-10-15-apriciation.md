# Appreciation
I would like to take this time to extend my gratitude to your team for this generosity donation that you made to the Coding ground.
My name is Mercy Mncube one of The Coding Ground Student,The funds that you gave to the Coding ground would help me to keep on coming to the coding ground and lean more so that I can be able to change my future and the lives of people in my community
I believe that if I can be able to change my future through coding I can also be able to pass on that knowledge to another person in my community.

With the money that you have donated to us,I will continue to have access to the internet,that will have a good impact to my learning as internet is the biggest contributor to my studies.
Some of it will be used for my transport fee so that I can be able to get to The coding ground.

Your support is highly appreciated,may your generosity continue changing lives in our country.
