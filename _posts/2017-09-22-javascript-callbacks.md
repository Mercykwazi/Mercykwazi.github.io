callbacks are one of the importent aspects that one must have a full understanding on especially when you are dealing with javascript.


Callback functions are from functional programming.

functional programming specifies the use of functions as arguments.

Callbacks can be a function that is passed to another function  as a parameter,

The callback function is called or execute inside that function. 

A callback function is called  a pattern,its use is therefore known as callback pattern.

Before implementing callbacks make sure you:
                                        Pass Parameters to Callback Functions
Since the callback function is just a normal function when it is executed, we can pass parameters to it.

                                        Make Sure Callback is a Function Before Executing It
 check that the callback function passed in the parameter is indeed a function before calling it.
