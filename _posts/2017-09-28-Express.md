Promise in javascript
It represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and it's value.

It is a proxy for a value nor necesarily known when the promise is created.

It allows you to associate handles with asynchronous action's eventual success value.

It lets asynchronous methords return values.

Instead of immediately returning the final value the methord returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.

It is in one of these states:
-Pending
Initial state,neither fulfilled nor rejected.

-fulfilled
The operation will be successfully completed.

-rejected
The oparation will have failed or rejected.

A Pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected.when either the two conditions are meet the associated handlers qued up by the promise are called .
