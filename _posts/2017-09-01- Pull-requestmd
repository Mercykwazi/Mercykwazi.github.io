Pull requst allows yor to tell others about the changes you have pushed to Github repository.

Once a pull request is sent,intrested parties can review the set of changes 

They can discuss potential modification and even push follow up commits if necessary.

Pull requests are commonly used by teams collaborating using shared repository model

Many open source projects on Github use pull request to change changes from contributers as they are useful in providing a way to notify projects mantainiers about changes one has made in intitial code review.

When creating a pull request there are two main work flows:

1....Pull request from  forced repository.

2....Pull request from a branch within a reposity.

After initializing a pull request you'll see a review of changes between your branch and the repository base branch. 

you can add a summary of the proposed changes, review changes made by commits.
