It is importent for one when writting code that is not only readeble but also understandeble for other people other than the writter.
The concerpt of clean code comes as a guid line on how you can ensure that you are writting a clean code.


                              -clean code
 It is a code that is easy to read,whether the reader is the original author of that code or not.
 when writting this code you need to ensure that the meaning of the code is clear and understandeble.
 The clear message helps to minimise misunderstanding of the code and possible guess works are also avoided.

  It is easy to understand 
    The reader must not strungle to understand what the code is saying or suppose to do.
 it's execution flow of the entire application
    The code must be easy to execute.
 How the diffrent objects collaborate with each other.
  The code should show how diffrent objects work with one another.
 The role and responsibility of each class
 Each class should play its role in the way that is it assigned to do.
 Your code should not have class that are not doing anything.
 It should be easy to extend and refactor.
When you want to extend and refactor your code it should not be difficult to do that.


As much as writting code can be excting for some people others mabye franstrating what-ever the case may be but it is very importent for a person to write a code that is clean.
