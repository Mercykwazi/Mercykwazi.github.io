When writing functions or code it is importent to have a good name for your function.
You dont want to have a function name  that does the opposite of what you assign it to. 
Giving functions good names is a process not a single step that you just take.


Here are some of the stages you go through before coming up with a good name for your function:
          -nonsense
            In this stage you just write a name that does not make much sense.
            In this stage you will just be wanting your function to have a name you can even write the longest name.
         -honest
           In this stage you will have writing your code you know what your function is suppose to do you can go back to the name you gave it and see where you can shorten it or give it another miningful name.
        -honest and complete
         If you have given your function a more meaningful name and then evaluate the name to see if the name is indeed inline whith what your function does.
        -does the right thing 
        Is your function name doing what the function is requiering for it to do,this is one of the question that  you need to ask your self at this stage.
        If your answer is yes then you have sucessfully named your function well.


coming up with good names is not that easy it is a process that one has to go through but once you have ticked green in all these stages,you are very sure that your naming is appropriety.
It is a process that is worth to go through,knowing that at the end you will have a good name.
