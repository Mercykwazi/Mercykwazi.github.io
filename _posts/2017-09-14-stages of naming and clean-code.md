####clean code
It is a code that is easy to read,whether the reader is the original author of that code or not.

Its meaning need to be clear so it minimise the need for guess work and misunderstanding.

It is easy to understand :

how the diffrent objects collaborate with each other.
the role and responsibility of each class
It should be easy to extend and refactor.
