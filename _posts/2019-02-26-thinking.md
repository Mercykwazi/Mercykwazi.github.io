# Thinking
People have different ways in which they think,they also have different levels in which they think based on.
The only way to solve a problem is to creatively think about the solution that is why it is importent to think.
The miner decisions that we take everyday in our lives involve thinking.

As a software developer it is important to think a lot before taking a decision because each and every decision you take will impact the way you solve your problem,whether you choose to you use an if statement or you choose to use a switch you should think careful before taking that decision.

Whether you chose to spend a lot of time writing code for the future or you spend the time refactoring the code you have written to be more readable which ever decision you take involves you thinking hard and careful about that decision.

 THINKING may mean I never observe my current thinking. My thinking contemplation is directed afterward on my past thought.
 In which ever way you may view thinking at the end of the day what ever you take and any decision you make it involves thinking.
