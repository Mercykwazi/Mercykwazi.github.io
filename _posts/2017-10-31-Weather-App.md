Weather is the condition of the atmosphere,it could be cold,hot or rainy.
It is there-for important to know what the weather has install for you before you plan your trip or day.
In this projected we were to create a local weather app.

In this project I first needed to do a little research about API, how they work so that i could be able to finish my project.
I found APIs very interesting because they are the driving force of my app.
I first had to understand how to transfer information that is appearing on my weather api to be visible for people to be able to view it.
I first console.log the Api so that it could be easy for me to see what I could display for my user to see and what not to display for my user.
I had a function called data that contained information of the Api.

I had created div inside it i had an id in my html that will hold the information that I want to display for my users.
In my js section i used the id to select what i wanted to be accessible for my users.
I also had a function that would convert the temperature from celsius to Fahrenheit,In case my user is at a location were they use Fahrenheit not celsius.
After creating that function I created a button that is click-able that will display the conversion that happens.

At the end  of this project I understood how Api work.
