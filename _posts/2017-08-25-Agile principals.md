Agile  principles:
Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery 
– Customers are happier when they receive working software at regular intervals, rather than waiting extended periods of time between releases.
Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process
– The ability to avoid delays when a requirement or feature request changes.
Frequent delivery of working software
 – Scrum accommodates this principle since the team operates in software sprints or iterations that ensure regular delivery of working software.
Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project
 – Better decisions are made when the business and technical team are aligned.
Support, trust, and motivate the people involved 
– Motivated teams are more likely to deliver their best work than unhappy teams.
Enable face-to-face interactions 
– Communication is more successful when development teams are co-located.
Working software is the primary measure of progress
 – Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress.
Agile processes to support a consistent development pace 
– Teams establish a repeatable and maintainable speed at which they can deliver working software, and they repeat it with each release.
Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility 
– The right skills and good design ensures the team can maintain the pace, constantly improve the product, and sustain change.
Simplicity
 – Develop just enough to get the job done for right now.
Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs 
– Skilled and motivated team members who have decision-making power, take ownership, communicate regularly with other team members, and share ideas that deliver quality products.
Regular reflections on how to become more effective
 – Self-improvement, process improvement, advancing skills, and techniques help team members work more efficiently.
